## Hi there, thanks for landing on my page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a self taught junior game developer. I have worked on projects both with and without online courses and continuously work on these in my free time. I work with Unreal Engine in C++ and I am coninuously expanding my knowledge through various online courses.

## My Projects
  - Run Sprite, Run! (Platformer)
    This is the first project I built on my own, it is a 2D beat-your-time platformer built with Unreal Engine's Blueprint system.
    I took a lot of enjoyment in making this game and watching friends and family beat it. I plan to add more intricate levels and make it even tougher to beat!

  - Cosmic Blaster
    This is a multiplayer shooter game that I created with a course on Udemy (big thanks to Stehen Ulibarri for his amazing work!). Although this is a follow-along course, I implemented a lot of my own features and gave it my own spin.
    I learnt a lot during this course, especially in mutliplayer and replication.

  - OpenWorldRPG
    As the very original name suggests, this is an open world RPG game, built in Unreal Engine using C++. Complete with a playable character, enemies and weapons.
    Another course by Stephen Ulibarri that I thoroughly enjoyed, a lot of emphasis on combat and level design.

  - Aura
    A top down RPG using Unreal Engine's Gameplay Ability System, working with attributes, ability systems and gameplay tags. This is a very involved course with lots to learn, but I have enjoyed every lecture and hurdle I have encounterd!
